# covid booster dose project
College project that was supposed to be programmed in C language.
Does 2 basic functions:
  1) Authenticate user
  2) Allocate vaccination spot
The project uses a regular 3 dimensional array as the data structure to imitate the vaccination booking procedure as follows:
  1) Dimension 1 : Time slot
  2) Dimension 2 : Room number
  3) Dimension 3 : Vaccination shots per room per time slot
Future prospects:
  1) The project makes use of rand() function to fill in the array but since the rand() function is biased and better implementation could be made using third-party library or self created random generator.
  2) Hidden input for passwords
  3) GUI using GTK+ library
